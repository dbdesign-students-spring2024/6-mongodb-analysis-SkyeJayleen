# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis

## Data Set Details

### Origin of Dataset
The dataset I used in this assignment is a [listing](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) of AirBnB accomodations that is provided by the AirBnB company. I focused specifically on the city of Bozeman in Montana, United States. The data set provides various information about each of the listings including the host, location, reviews, ratings, descriptions and more. The original file was in a CSV format.

I've done some traveling around the world and I just couldn't leave "The Last Best Place". I am a designer at A&E Design, a local Architecture and Design Firm.   I live in the main house of the property with my black lab mix 'River'.  We spend a lot of our time outside on the river, slopes, hunting, camping, or hanging out in Historic Downtown Bozeman.   We look forward to accommodating you and your adventure to this great town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |within an hour    |100%              |100%                |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0c0127f3-b094-4e00-9475-856b88234808.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                       |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0c0127f3-b094-4e00-9475-856b88234808.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                       |                  |1                  |1                        |['email', 'phone', 'work_email']|t                   |t                     |                               |Bozeman               |                            |45.68422|-111.03839|Entire guesthouse   |Entire home/apt|2           |         |1 bath        |        |1   |[]       |$139.00|3             |1125          |2                     |3                     |1125                  |1125                  |2.7                   |1125.0                |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |0               |2023-12-10           |454              |74                   |3                     |2013-11-22  |2023-12-02 |4.97                |4.98                  |4.96                     |4.99                 |4.99                       |4.92                  |4.94               |       |f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |3.71             |

I also work in renewable energy - solar thermal, permaculture, electric bikes, and biofuels - and strive to keep Bozeman Cottage low impact.  I stock the houses with non-toxic body products and cleaners, and are as efficient as possible with heating and cooling.  I also run a bicycle rental business so you can easily and affordably see Bozeman on 2-wheels!  Note: I manage a few different guest houses and reviews are shown collectively for all places. The few reservations that had to be cancelled over the years were mostly due to date conflicts when calendars failed to update automatically. The July 2016 reservation was cancelled when the guests revealed that they had two cats after using autobook, for which Airbnb charged me 100, so unfortunately I no longer use autobook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |within an hour    |100%              |100%                |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f9efc11c-1d61-4d59-9536-629dd2ddd084.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                       |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f9efc11c-1d61-4d59-9536-629dd2ddd084.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                       |                  |24                 |36                       |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Bozeman, Montana, United States|Bozeman               |                            |45.68563|-111.03118|Entire home         |Entire home/apt|4           |         |1.5 baths     |        |2   |[]       |$198.00|3             |30            |4                     |7                     |30                    |30                    |4.9                   |30.0                  |                |t               |30             |53             |75             |332             |2023-12-10           |35               |2                    |0                     |2014-05-27  |2023-09-02 |4.74                |4.89                  |4.8                      |4.94                 |4.97                       |4.97                  |4.68               |       |f               |22                            |22                                         |0                                           |0                                          |0.30             |

We love the experience of staying in a home and getting familiar with a neighborhood when we travel and we are happy to pass that experience along to our guests.  We reside in Livingston, Montana where we spend our free time floating the rivers, fishing and camping in the summers and skiing at nearby Bridger Bowl in the winter.  We prefer our privacy and independence when we travel but are always open to local tips and suggestions and we are happy to give you the same when you come to Montana. We are both local business owners who have a combined 30+ years in the area. We are more than happy to share any knowledge of the area that we have with you.

I love the warm season here and my husband loves the cold-you will get plenty of input from us if you need suggestions on what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |within an hour    |100%              |77%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f58665cd-b17c-4580-9b1a-c2ac4e4b4c83.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                       |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f58665cd-b17c-4580-9b1a-c2ac4e4b4c83.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                       |                  |2                  |2                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Bozeman, Montana, United States|Bozeman               |                            |45.67241|-111.04913|Entire guesthouse   |Entire home/apt|4           |         |1 bath        |        |1   |[]       |$125.00|2             |1125          |2                     |2                     |1125                  |1125                  |2.0                   |1125.0                |                |t               |9              |33             |33             |93              |2023-12-10           |175              |11                   |0                     |2015-07-22  |2023-10-23 |4.94                |4.94                  |4.82                     |4.98                 |4.98                       |4.94                  |4.88               |       |f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |1.71             |

And just two blocks from our home is Bozeman's Southside Park, with a play ground for kids, plus tennis/pickle ball courts, and in the winter,  an ice skating rink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/50407833/6450630b_original.jpg                                                |20738079|https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/20738079|Lori         |2014-08-30|Bozeman, MT      |We found our home with a promise of rhubarb pies . . .   Here is the back story to that rather strange sounding statement. My husband is from Alaska but went to dental school in San Francisco, where we met. He knew he had to get back to the mountains - so we spent the late 1990's searching for our "forever" college/mountain town. Our first visit to Bozeman and we knew it would be our future community - but the search for the "forever" home proved more difficult.   Eventually, we placed notes on the doors of our favorite Bozeman homes, promising 20 years of rhubarb pies to anyone who led us to our forever home. Jane, the sweet grandmother who owned this 1920's  former sorority house responded, saying she had a rhubarb plant in the backyard and wanted to sell to a young family who would take good care of the place - and the rest is history.   The summer of 2020 we will deliver our 20th rhubarb pie to Jane!   Here are a few other details you might want to know about your potential host (Website hidden by Airbnb) taught culture related courses (e.g. "The Cultural Dimensions of International Business" & "Film, Photos & Culture: A Global Perspective") at Montana State University for about 15 years until I retired in 2020. My husband, Scott, daughter, Sumner and I were part-time ski instructors at Big Sky in the past, but now just ski for fun.  Scott is an avid bike rider, and even completed the 2,500+ mile "Great Divide Mountain Bike Ride" in the fall of 2016. Which means he rode from Banff, Canada to Mexico, on a mountain bike. He did it over a series of week-long segments - camping out along the way. When he is not riding he works doing dentistry here in Bozeman.   Sumner studied "Global Health & Education" at Colorado College, and graduated in 2018. She nordic and Alpine skis, runs and climbs and is now in medical school at the University of Washington.   Sumner's pup, Magnolia is a Bernedoodle. She is very friendly - but a bit shy at first.  She might bark - and also wag her tail - the 1st time she see's you but once you've been introduced she warms up quickly.  We are looking forward to hosting you, and hope you have a great experience here in Bozeman! |within an hour    |100%              |100%                |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/20738079/profile_pic/1434177122/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                           |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/20738079/profile_pic/1434177122/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                           |                  |1                  |2                        |['email', 'phone', 'work_email']|t                   |t                     |Bozeman, Montana, United States|Bozeman               |                            |45.66932|-111.04256|Entire guest suite  |Entire home/apt|3           |         |1 bath        |        |2   |[]       |$194.00|1             |1125          |1                     |1                     |1125                  |1125                  |1.0                   |1125.0                |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |0               |2023-12-10           |223              |46                   |2                     |2015-06-14  |2023-12-03 |4.99                |5.0                   |4.97                     |5.0                  |4.99                       |5.0                   |4.94               |       |f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |2.16             |

During that time our family lived abroad in Lugano, Switzerland, and then Surrey, England for over 9 years, returning to our home once or twice a year to stay in touch with lovely Bozeman and our wonderful local friends. We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more.   I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower.   I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others.   Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |within an hour    |100%              |95%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ada6c22f-fdc9-447e-99f8-c1adb5ff0937.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                       |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ada6c22f-fdc9-447e-99f8-c1adb5ff0937.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                       |                  |3                  |3                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Bozeman, Montana, United States|Bozeman               |                            |45.67114|-111.04041|Entire place        |Entire home/apt|3           |         |1 bath        |        |2   |[]       |$265.00|4             |120           |4                     |4                     |1125                  |1125                  |4.0                   |1125.0                |                |t               |30             |60             |90             |179             |2023-12-10           |87               |7                    |0                     |2014-11-15  |2023-10-17 |4.92                |4.85                  |4.93                     |4.99                 |5.0                        |4.96                  |4.87               |       |f               |3                             |3                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.79             |

We  decided two years into retirement instead of staying in (Hidden by Airbnb) ’s to turn houses we purchased in Bozeman, Montana (our favorite place)  and Columbia , Missouri into (Hidden by Airbnb) ’s.  We love the lifestyle of living close to our families who are in different states and then renting our houses to people that need short term rentals.  We set our houses up with our guests in mind which simplifies and streamlines our living as well. We have met absolutely wonderful people along this 10 year journey and love the lifestyle. We enjoy hiking, biking, kayaking, fishing, watercolor and most of all hanging out with family.  We try to live by the motto  "treat others as you would have them treat you" and generally all else falls in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |N/A               |N/A               |0%                  |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/14101343/profile_pic/1418152053/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                           |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/14101343/profile_pic/1418152053/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                           |                  |2                  |9                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Bozeman, Montana, United States|Bozeman               |                            |45.68605|-111.07734|Entire home         |Entire home/apt|4           |         |2 baths       |        |2   |[]       |$139.00|3             |182           |3                     |3                     |182                   |182                   |3.0                   |182.0                 |                |t               |1              |1              |1              |1               |2023-12-10           |0                |0                    |0                     |            |           |                    |                      |                         |                     |                           |                      |                   |       |f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |                 |

So when I am not in the peaceful surroundings of my townhouse, you will find me and Gerty, my 11 pound Brussels Griffon, enjoying the solitude of the mountains just outside the steps of Grace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |N/A               |N/A               |100%                |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/35514344/profile_pic/1433990716/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                           |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/35514344/profile_pic/1433990716/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                           |                  |1                  |2                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Bozeman, Montana, United States|Bozeman               |                            |45.679  |-111.08748|Entire townhouse    |Entire home/apt|2           |         |2 baths       |        |2   |[]       |$250.00|28            |1125          |28                    |28                    |1125                  |1125                  |28.0                  |1125.0                |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |199             |2023-12-10           |15               |0                    |0                     |2015-06-17  |2021-03-07 |4.93                |5.0                   |5.0                      |5.0                  |5.0                        |4.85                  |4.92               |       |f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.15             |

The location offers a perfect balance of proximity and privacy.  Just far enough off of Main for tranquility but only a minute or two walk to the heart of Downtown.

I love this fun town and am happy to share it with you.  I grew up in the military; moving around, traveling to amazing places, and forming life-long relationships with amazing people.  Now that I no longer move around, having my homes in Airbnb is a great way to have new people come my way!  I live in Bozeman, MT and take advantage of all there is to offer. Love finding the hidden treasures in this state.  I have rental homes in Bozeman and Livingston, MT and Sun Valley (Ketchum), ID.  They are all in the downtown areas, all in wonderful little towns.  Someday, I may find myself beep bopping from one to the other.  I currently sell real estate in Montana, so if you come this way and fall in love, like everyone does... you know who to call!  If you do stay at one of my homes, I do hope you enjoy it.

### Problems / scrubbing

The original structure of the data includes many fields that makes the data not immediately intuitive to read; the table contains a lot of long information including sentences of the listing or the host's description. I decided to do some scrubbing using Python in the [munge.py](munge.py) file. I used the CSV module to import the data into a list of dictionaries.

First, for the sake of my analysis, I cut down the fields to just those needed in the analysis, which includes:
- id
- name
- price
- neighbourhood
- host_name
- host_is_superhost
- host_id
- beds
- neighbourhood_group_cleansed
- review_scores_rating

Next, I moved onto cleaning some special characters in specific fields that could interfere with data saving and analysis. One issue was that the majority of the documents in the field "neighbourhood" contained the text "Bozeman, Montana, United States".

While it doesn't seem like an issue upfront and this issue was first overlooked, I later ran into an issue as I was saving the data. I was planning to save the data back into a new CSV file by parsing each document by commas, however, the commas inside the single field was being counted as commas being used to parse the fields apart, which ended up pushing "Montana" and "United States" to latter fields and pushing out the following fields into new, empty fields. So I decided to replace the commas with a semicolon(;) using the function below:

```
def replacecomma(column):
    for i in data:
        i[column] = i[column].replace(",", ";")
```

Another issue arose in another field, "price", where the prices of the listings were all marked with a dollar sign($). This could interfere in data analysis later in MongoDB, so I decided to take out the dollar sign.

In the same field, a similar issue with the commas in "neighbourhood" arose; one specific listing with host_id of 738975280279449873 had a pricing of 2,100, which was the only number going over the hundredth place in the entire field. For this document, I also got rid of the comma to avoid incorrect parsing as well.

Lastly, as a safety measure, I checked that all the documents in the "price" didn't have anything behind the decimal point despite all having the trailing zeroes(".00); I got rid of them just so I can be sure MongoDB will treat the values in this field as numbers instead of strings. Hence, the function below was used:

```
def cleanprice(column):
    for i in data:
        i[column] = i[column].replace(",", "")
        i[column] = i[column].replace("$", "")
        i[column] = i[column].replace(".00", "")
```


## Analysis

1. Two documents in any order

I displayed the first two documents listed in the database using the code below:

```
db.listings_clean.find().limit(2)
```

The results were as shown below:

```
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1dd8'),
    id: 2390321,
    name: 'Rental unit in Bozeman · ★4.95 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath',
    host_id: 7849959,
    host_name: 'Irene',
    host_is_superhost: 'f',
    neighbourhood: 'Bozeman; Montana; United States',
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed: '',
    beds: 1,
    price: 150,
    review_scores_rating: 4.95
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1dd9'),
    id: 2536175,
    name: 'Home in Bozeman · ★4.77 · 3 bedrooms · 3 beds · 2 baths',
    host_id: 8287259,
    host_name: 'Kris And Alex',
    host_is_superhost: 'f',
    neighbourhood: 'Bozeman; Montana; United States',
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed: '',
    beds: 3,
    price: 160,
    review_scores_rating: 4.77
  }
]

```


2. Ten pretty documents

I displayed the first ten documents in a format easier to read, using the code below:
```
db.listings_clean.find().limit(10).pretty()
```

The first three results were as shown below:
```
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1dd8'),
    id: 2390321,
    name: 'Rental unit in Bozeman · ★4.95 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath',
    host_id: 7849959,
    host_name: 'Irene',
    host_is_superhost: 'f',
    neighbourhood: 'Bozeman; Montana; United States',
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed: '',
    beds: 1,
    price: 150,
    review_scores_rating: 4.95
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1dd9'),
    id: 2536175,
    name: 'Home in Bozeman · ★4.77 · 3 bedrooms · 3 beds · 2 baths',
    host_id: 8287259,
    host_name: 'Kris And Alex',
    host_is_superhost: 'f',
    neighbourhood: 'Bozeman; Montana; United States',
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed: '',
    beds: 3,
    price: 160,
    review_scores_rating: 4.77
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1dda'),
    id: 2839082,
    name: 'Home in Bozeman · ★4.97 · 2 bedrooms · 2 beds · 1 bath',
    host_id: 1577112,
    host_name: 'Zack',
    host_is_superhost: 'f',
    neighbourhood: 'Bozeman; Montana; United States',
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed: '',
    beds: 2,
    price: 650,
    review_scores_rating: 4.97
  }, ...
]
```

3. Two superhosts' listings

I chose two hosts at random by their host_id and displayed all of the listings offered by both of the two hosts, showing only the relevant fields using the code below:
```
db.listings_clean.find({$or: [ { host_id:2490712 }, { host_id:9892898 } ] } , { name: 1, price:1, neighbourhood:1, host_name:1, host_is_superhost:1 } )
```

The results were as shown below:
```
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1dea'),
    name: 'Home in Bozeman · ★4.97 · 2 bedrooms · 2 beds · 2 baths',
    host_name: 'Stacie',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighbourhood: 'Bozeman; Montana; United States',
    price: 160
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1deb'),
    name: 'Guesthouse in Bozeman · ★4.97 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath',
    host_name: 'Brian',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighbourhood: '',
    price: 139
  }
]

```

4. Unique hosts

I found all the names of unique hosts using the code below:
```
db.listings_clean.distinct("host_name")
```

The results were as shown below:
```
[
  'Abigail',         'Alayna',          'Alexa',
  'Alexandria',      'Alison',          'Alli',
  'Allison',         'Amanda',          'Ambrose & Jill',

  'Indra',
  ... 188 more items
]
```

5. Listings with more than 2 beds

I found all the listings that has more than 2 beds in a price range lower than 200, instead of in a particular neighborhood, as my dataset has only one neighborhood. I displayed only relevant fields and also ordered the documents by descending rating scores. The code below was used:
```
db.listings_clean.find({'price':{$lt: 200}, 'beds':{$gt: 2}}, { name: 1, beds:1, review_scores_rating:1, price:1}).sort({'review_scores_rating': -1})
```

The first three results were as shown below:
```
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1ecb'),
    name: 'Home in Bozeman · 3 bedrooms · 4 beds · 2.5 baths',
    beds: 4,
    price: 167,
    review_scores_rating: ''
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1ed0'),
    name: 'Townhouse in Bozeman · 3 bedrooms · 3 beds · 3 baths',
    beds: 3,
    price: 150,
    review_scores_rating: ''
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660f0e4ec34b7fbd6a5a1ed2'),
    name: 'Condo in Bozeman · 2 bedrooms · 3 beds · 2 baths',
    beds: 3,
    price: 134,
    review_scores_rating: ''
  }, ...
]
```

6. Number of listings per host

I found the number of listings per host, using the code below:
```
db.listings_clean.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: '$host_id', listings: { $sum: 1 } } }] )
```

I could have replaced $host_id with $host_name to make it more comprehensible, but since there could be multiple people of the same name, I decided to use the unique IDs to avoid confusion.

The first three results were as shown below:
```
[
  { _id: 545489115, listings: 3 },
  { _id: 544251726, listings: 1 },
  { _id: 5216140, listings: 1 }, ...
]
```

7. Average ratings per neighborhood

I found the average rating scores, grouping the listings by whether the host was superhost or not, displaying them in descending order of rating. Again, as my dataset only has one neighborhood, the superhost True/False was the query I used. The code below was used:

```
db.listings_clean.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: '$host_is_superhost', avgrating: { $avg: '$review_scores_rating' } } }] )
```

The results were as shown below:
```
[
  { _id: 't', avgrating: 4.914879356568365 },
  { _id: 'f', avgrating: 4.880896551724138 }
]
```
