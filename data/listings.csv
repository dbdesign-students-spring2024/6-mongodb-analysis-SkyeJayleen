Here is the back story to that rather strange sounding statement. My husband is from Alaska but went to dental school in San Francisco, where we met. He knew he had to get back to the mountains - so we spent the late 1990's searching for our ""forever"" college/mountain town. Our first visit to Bozeman and we knew it would be our future community - but the search for the ""forever"" home proved more difficult. 

Eventually, we placed notes on the doors of our favorite Bozeman homes, promising 20 years of rhubarb pies to anyone who led us to our forever home. Jane, the sweet grandmother who owned this 1920's  former sorority house responded, saying she had a rhubarb plant in the backyard and wanted to sell to a young family who would take good care of the place - and the rest is history. 

The summer of 2020 we will deliver our 20th rhubarb pie to Jane! 

Here are a few other details you might want to know about your potential host (Website hidden by Airbnb) taught culture related courses (e.g. ""The Cultural Dimensions of International Business"" & ""Film, Photos & Culture: A Global Perspective"") at Montana State University for about 15 years until I retired in 2020. My husband, Scott, daughter, Sumner and I were part-time ski instructors at Big Sky in the past, but now just ski for fun.

Scott is an avid bike rider, and even completed the 2,500+ mile ""Great Divide Mountain Bike Ride"" in the fall of 2016. Which means he rode from Banff, Canada to Mexico, on a mountain bike. He did it over a series of week-long segments - camping out along the way. When he is not riding he works doing dentistry here in Bozeman. 

Sumner studied ""Global Health & Education"" at Colorado College, and graduated in 2018. She nordic and Alpine skis, runs and climbs and is now in medical school at the University of Washington. 

Sumner's pup, Magnolia is a Bernedoodle. She is very friendly - but a bit shy at first.  She might bark - and also wag her tail - the 1st time she see's you but once you've been introduced she warms up quickly.

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.

My name is Reno Walsh. I am the owner of Bozeman Montana Vacation Rentals. 

I sincerely appreciate Bozeman, Montana. I moved here in 1995 and immediately launched a career in the tourism industry. I met my wife to be on the summit of Saddle Peak in the Bridger Mountain Range just outside of town and a few years later I proposed to her in a raft on Montana’s Smith River. We were married downtown Bozeman at Lindley Park. Today we are the proud parents of two living in our own home on Bozeman’s northeast side. I’m an active volunteer and leader in the community. I’m the owner of a successful short-term rental and long-term downtown Bozeman vacation rental on North Montana Ave.

Bozeman Montana Vacation Rentals understands the importance of excellent customer service. I’ve guided thousands of guests around the world on active vacations. I’ve hosted thousands at food, wine, and beer conferences around the world. And, we have hosted over a thousand guests at our vacation rentals.

We originally built our 1200 sq. ft. addition for our family to come visit us but as they aged and with covid, it got too hard for them to visit. So we decided to start sharing it with guests from all over the world and it has been a wonderful experience. We truly love meeting our wonderful guests and getting to know them. 

Like so many other hosts, our family of 5 (plus Timber, our 1.5-year-old Chocolate Lab) loves to travel and we have been fortunate to see many places around the world.  Living in Montana has given all of us a deep appreciation of the natural world and its infinite activities. We all enjoy hiking, camping, rock climbing, and skiing. We have hiked all over Yellowstone and throughout the Gallatin mountains. 

In the springtime, I fly fish almost nightly in the two rivers behind our home on the other side of the Bridger Creek Golf Course.

I sincerely appreciate Bozeman, Montana. I moved here in 1995 and immediately launched a career in the tourism industry. I met my wife to be on the summit of Saddle Peak in the Bridger Mountain Range just outside of town and a few years later I proposed to her in a raft on Montana’s Smith River. We were married downtown Bozeman at Lindley Park. Today we are the proud parents of two living in our own home on Bozeman’s northeast side. I’m an active volunteer and leader in the community. I’m the owner of a successful short-term rental and long-term downtown Bozeman vacation rental on North Montana Ave.

Bozeman Montana Vacation Rentals understands the importance of excellent customer service. I’ve guided thousands of guests around the world on active vacations. I’ve hosted thousands at food, wine, and beer conferences around the world. And, we have hosted over a thousand guests at our vacation rentals.

During that time our family lived abroad in Lugano, Switzerland, and then Surrey, England for over 9 years, returning to our home once or twice a year to stay in touch with lovely Bozeman and our wonderful local friends. We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/50f88a6c-afdf-435f-92e1-174d0a389cb3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/50f88a6c-afdf-435f-92e1-174d0a389cb3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,60,193,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Bozeman,,45.67618580039208,-111.0494485884948,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,7,,1 bath,,4,[],$239.00,2,1125,2,4,2,1125,2.3,40.2,,t,30,60,90,362,2023-12-10,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,t,1,1,0,0,

During that time our family lived abroad in Lugano, Switzerland, and then Surrey, England for over 9 years, returning to our home once or twice a year to stay in touch with lovely Bozeman and our wonderful local friends. We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.
